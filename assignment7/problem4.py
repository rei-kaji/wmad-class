# Problem4
# - Implement a function which receives a list of numbers as an input parameter. The
# function will find a sub-list from the list which is sorted and its length is greater than 4
# and return the sub-list. If there are more than 1 sub-list, the function can return only one
# of them. If there is no such sub-list in the list, the function will return None.

list1 = [1, 3, 2, 9, 6, 4, 3, 2, 5, 5, -1]


def function(list1):
    if len(list1) >= 4:
        while True:
            for size in range(4, len(list1)):
                for startIndex in range(len(list1)-size):
                    subList = list1[startIndex:startIndex+size]
                    if subList == sorted(subList) or subList == sorted(subList, reverse=True):
                        return subList

            return None

    else:
        return None


print(function(list1))
